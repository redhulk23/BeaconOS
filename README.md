# BeaconOS

**An Operating System and Platform for Enterprise AI Agents**

BeaconOS is a platform that provides the foundational infrastructure for deploying, managing, and orchestrating AI agents within any business. Drawing from traditional operating system concepts — process scheduling, memory management, access control, and inter-process communication — BeaconOS adapts these proven paradigms for the era of autonomous AI agents.

## Vision

Every business will soon run dozens to hundreds of AI agents handling tasks across customer support, data analysis, workflow automation, system integration, and more. BeaconOS provides the unified platform to manage this complexity — giving businesses the control plane they need to deploy agents safely, monitor them effectively, and scale them efficiently.

## Core Capabilities

- **Agent Lifecycle Management** — Define, build, test, deploy, monitor, update, and retire agents
- **Kernel Services** — Scheduling, context management, memory management, and resource allocation
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration** — Pipeline, fan-out, hierarchical, and consensus patterns
- **Security & Governance** — Identity, access control, guardrails, and audit trails
- **Enterprise Integration** — Connectors for CRM, ERP, databases, SaaS tools, and more
- **Human-in-the-Loop** — Approval workflows, oversight dashboards, and intervention mechanisms
- **Observability** — Tracing, logging, metrics, and debugging across all agent activity
- **Developer Experience** — SDKs, templates, testing frameworks, and CI/CD for agents
